							<h2>Hacking in Online Gaming</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The word "hacking" often is often taken in a negative connotation. In the online gaming scene, hacking, is seen as cheating, scummy, and pathetic; however, we at Feeder Inc. see the positive sides of hacking. Hacking is often used to increase the cyber security of websites against other hackers and hacking is also used to provide justice to others. In the online gaming, hacking provides justice to the gamers who lack the skill to be considered good in the unfair ranking systems of famous online games. These players who lack basic functionallity in videogames get justice by using hacks. Hacks provide them the option to excel in videogames which they could not before because they were born with the inability to play online videogames at a high tier level without getting carried. Hacking can be used for good. </p>
						<hr />
						<h3>What Hacking means to us</h3>
						<p>Hacking to us is a way to liberate those who are shackled to their terrible skills as a gamer. Rather than working hard and getting better at the game, why not just download hacks and take the shortcut to the top. We at Feeder Inc. make money and you get your desired rank, it's a win win situation! </p>
